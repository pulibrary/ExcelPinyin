# Excel Pinyin Converter

This plugin allows you to convert Chinese characters in a spreadsheet to pinyin, according to ALA-LC cataloging standards.   To install, download and run the following installer:

After installing the plugin, the Excel ribbon should have a tab called “Library Tools”, with a button called “Convert to Pinyin”.  Simply highlight the cells or column you want to convert, then click the button.  (All the cells must be in a single column).  A new column will be inserted to the right of the selected column, and the pinyin will be written there.  A dialog box will show the progress of the conversion.  Simply click "stop" to end the macro, though the text that has been converted to far will remain in the result column.
